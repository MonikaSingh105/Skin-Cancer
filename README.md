# Overview
This project aims to detect and classify different skin care products using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various skin care products, and it can predict the category or type of each product.
# Understanding the Data
Skin cancer is not only the most common human malignancy but also a complex medical enigma. The visual subtleties in skin lesions often lead to challenges in accurate and early diagnosis. In a world where precision matters, can artificial intelligence bring a new dimension to this battle? Introducing the HAM10000 dataset ("Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images"), a gold mine for researchers and data scientists, consisting of 10,015 dermatoscopic images. 

This dataset represents a stepping stone towards automation in skin cancer classification, with its seven different classes:
​
Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions:
​
1. Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (AKIEC),
2. basal cell carcinoma (BCC),
​3. benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, BKL),
​4. dermatofibroma (DF),
​5. melanoma (MEL),
​6. melanocytic nevi (NV)
​7. vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, VASC).
